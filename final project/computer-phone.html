            <ol>
                <li>Recognize the problem: Admit that you have a computer or phone addiction and that it's impacting your life in negative ways.</li>
                <li>Set achievable goals: Decide on specific, achievable goals for reducing your computer or phone use and stick to them.</li>
                <li>Create a structured schedule: Develop a daily routine that includes structured activities and limits your computer or phone use to specific times and for specific purposes.</li>
                <li>Find alternative activities: Engage in activities that do not involve computers or phones, such as exercise, reading, spending time with friends and family, or pursuing hobbies.</li>
                <li>Limit your access: Implement controls on your computer or phone use, such as using internet filters, disabling notifications for non-essential apps, or setting strict limits on your screen time.</li>
                <li>Get support: Seek support from friends, family, or a professional therapist to help you overcome your addiction.</li>
                <li>Practice mindfulness: Pay attention to your thoughts and feelings while using computers or phones and be mindful of when you start to feel stressed, anxious, or overwhelmed.</li>
                <li>Rely on healthy coping mechanisms: Develop healthy coping mechanisms, such as deep breathing, meditation, and mindfulness, to manage stress and anxiety.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Breaking a computer or phone addiction takes time and effort, but with dedication and support, it's possible to regain control and live a more balanced life.</p>
