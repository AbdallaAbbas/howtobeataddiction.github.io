                <li>Create a structured schedule: Develop a daily routine that includes structured activities and limits your internet use to specific times and for specific purposes.</li>
                <li>Find alternative activities: Engage in activities that do not involve the internet, such as exercise, reading, spending time with friends and family, or pursuing hobbies.</li>
                <li>Limit your access: Implement controls on your internet use, such as using internet filters or disabling notifications for non-essential apps.</li>
                <li>Get support: Seek support from friends, family, or a professional therapist to help you overcome your addiction.</li>
                <li>Practice mindfulness: Pay attention to your thoughts and feelings while using the internet and be mindful of when you start to feel stressed, anxious, or overwhelmed.</li>
                <li>Rely on healthy coping mechanisms: Develop healthy coping mechanisms, such as deep breathing, meditation, and mindfulness, to manage stress and anxiety.</li>
            </ol>
